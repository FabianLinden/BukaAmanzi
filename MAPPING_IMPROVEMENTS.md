# BukaAmanzi Data Quality and Mapping Improvements

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements implemented to address data quality issues and enhance the project location mapping system in the BukaAmanzi water infrastructure monitoring platform.

## Overview

The analysis revealed that **85% of projects** lacked precise coordinates and many contained placeholder/template data. These improvements significantly enhance data quality assessment, location accuracy, and user experience.

## üéØ Key Issues Addressed

### 1. **Data Quality Problems**
- 85% of projects lacking precise coordinates
- Generic placeholder names like "Water Infrastructure Project 1"
- Inconsistent data completeness across projects
- Projects clustered at municipality centers instead of actual locations

### 2. **Location Mapping Issues**
- Heavy reliance on municipality center fallbacks
- No geocoding service for address-to-coordinate conversion
- Missing location confidence indicators
- Visual confusion between exact and approximate locations

### 3. **User Experience**
- No filtering options for data quality
- Lack of transparency about location accuracy
- No clustering for dense project areas
- Missing data quality disclaimers

## üöÄ Implemented Solutions

### 1. Data Quality Assessment Service (`backend/app/services/data_quality.py`)

**Features:**
- Comprehensive project quality scoring (0-100 scale)
- Multi-dimensional assessment covering:
  - Name quality (20 points) - Detects generic/template names
  - Location data (25 points) - Validates coordinates and addresses  
  - Financial data (20 points) - Checks budget allocation and spending
  - Temporal data (15 points) - Validates project timelines
  - Descriptive data (10 points) - Assesses description and contractor info
  - Status consistency (10 points) - Validates status vs progress alignment

**Quality Tiers:**
- **Excellent** (90-100): Complete, high-quality data
- **Good** (80-89): Mostly complete with minor gaps
- **Fair** (60-79): Adequate but missing some key information
- **Poor** (40-59): Significant data gaps
- **Very Poor** (0-39): Minimal or template data

**Template Detection:**
- Identifies generic project names
- Detects placeholder descriptions
- Flags obvious demo/test data

### 2. Geocoding Service (`backend/app/services/geocoding.py`)

**Features:**
- Multiple geocoding providers (OpenStreetMap Nominatim, Photon)
- Rate limiting and caching (30-day cache)
- South Africa boundary validation
- Confidence scoring for geocoded results
- Batch processing capabilities
- Address normalization

**Geocoding Pipeline:**
1. Check existing coordinates
2. Normalize and clean addresses
3. Try multiple geocoding providers
4. Validate results within South Africa
5. Cache successful results
6. Return confidence-scored locations

### 3. Enhanced API Endpoints (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/data_quality.py`)

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/data-quality/assessment` - Comprehensive quality assessment
- `GET /api/v1/data-quality/filtered-projects` - Quality-filtered project list
- `POST /api/v1/data-quality/geocode` - Address geocoding

- **Improved Popups:** Comprehensive project information with quality indicators

#### Data Quality Utilities (`frontend/src/utils/projectDataUtils.ts`)
- Quality score calculation functions
- Template data detection
- API integration functions for quality assessment
- Enhanced municipality location mapping (100+ South African municipalities)

#### Dashboard Enhancements (`frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`)
- Data quality disclaimer
- Location accuracy notices
- Map legend with clustering indicators
- Quality statistics display

## üìä Data Quality Scoring System

### Scoring Breakdown:
```
Name Quality        (20 pts): Generic names, descriptiveness, keywords
Location Quality    (25 pts): Exact coordinates, addresses, mappability
Financial Quality   (20 pts): Budget allocation, spending data, consistency
Temporal Quality    (15 pts): Start/end dates, duration reasonableness
Descriptive Quality (10 pts): Project description, contractor information
Status Quality      (10 pts): Status consistency, progress alignment
```

### Quality Indicators:
- **Green Markers**: Exact coordinates, high confidence
- **Orange Markers**: Municipality center approximation
- **Dashed Borders**: Incomplete data
- **Size Variation**: Reflects location confidence
- **Clustering**: Groups projects in dense areas

## üó∫Ô∏è Location Confidence System

### Confidence Levels:
1. **High**: Exact GPS coordinates from project data
2. **Medium**: Geocoded from detailed addresses
3. **Low**: Municipality center approximation or fuzzy matching
4. **None**: Fallback to South Africa center (filtered out)

### Municipality Mapping:
- 100+ South African municipalities mapped
- Major metros with precise coordinates
- District and local municipalities covered
- Fuzzy matching for name variations

## üéõÔ∏è Filtering and Display Options

### Quality Filters:
- **Minimum Quality Score**: Filter by score threshold
- **Exclude Template Data**: Hide obvious placeholder projects
- **Quality Tiers**: Filter by specific quality levels
- **Location Confidence**: Show only projects with reliable locations

### Map Features:
- **Smart Clustering**: Groups nearby projects automatically
- **Confidence Indicators**: Visual cues for location reliability
- **Quality Disclaimers**: Clear communication about data limitations
- **Interactive Legend**: Explains all visual elements

## üìà Impact and Results

### Before Implementation:
- 47 projects total
- ~7 projects with exact coordinates (15%)
- ~40 projects with generic/template names (85%)
- No quality assessment or filtering
- Confusing map display with clustered municipality centers

### After Implementation:
- Comprehensive quality scoring for all projects
- Clear separation of high-quality vs template data
- Geocoding capability for address-to-coordinate conversion
- Enhanced map visualization with clustering
- Transparent communication about data limitations
- Filtering options for different use cases

### Test Results:
```

High Quality Only (min_score=80, exclude_template=true):  
  Projects: 2/5 (40% pass rate)

Template Data Detection:
  Identified: 2/5 projects as template data (40%)
```
